# vmmul instructional test harness

This directory contains a benchmark harness for testing different implementations of
vector-matrix multiply (VMM) for varying problem sizes.

The main code is benchmark.cpp, which sets up the problem, iterates over problem
sizes, sets up the vector and matrix, executes the vmmul call, and tests the
result for accuracy by comparing your result against a reference implementation (CBLAS).

Note that cmake needs to be able to find the CBLAS package. For CSC 746/656 Fall 2022,
this condition is true on Perlmutter@NERSC and on the class VM. It is also true for some
other platforms, but you are on your own if using a platform other than Perlmutter@NERSC
or the class VM.

# Build instructions - general

After downloading the code, you may first need to make modifications to your environment to access the correct compilers. See below for more information.

Once your environment is set up, then cd into the main source directly, then:

> mkdir build  
> cd build  
> cmake ../  

When building on Cori, you may do compilations and brief runs on a login node. Load the PrgEnv-intel module first to set up your environment:

> module load PrgEnv-intel

When building on Perlmutter, make sure you are on a GPU node when doing the compilation. Compiling and running your code on Perlmutter Login nodes is not recommended. The simplest way to do this is
grab an interactive GPU node by running the below command after logging into Perlmutter:  
> salloc --nodes=1 --qos=interactive --time=00:15:00 --constraint=gpu --account=m3930

# Build peculiarities for MacOSX platforms:

1. Compiler version. The default version of g++ shipped with the the development library is Apple clang version 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9) and this version of the compiler WILL NOT WORK with this assignment because it does not support OpenMP. The simplest fix is to install a new compiler: brew install gcc, which will install the most current version of gcc/g++, which is 11.2.0 as of the time of this writing.

There may be a way to force Apple's clang to enable OpenMP. See this thread, which Prof. Bethel has not tried: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44380459/is-openmp-available-in-high-sierra-llvm/47230419#47230419

2. Setting the CXXFLAGS to point to the directory containing cblas.h.
On Prof. Bethel's laptop, which is an intel-based Macbook Pro running Big Sur (MacOS 11.6), and
with Xcode installed, cmake (version 3.20.1) can find the BLAS package, but then the build fails with
an error about not being able to find cblas.h.

The workaround is to tell cmake where cblas.h lives by using an environment variable:
export CXXFLAGS="-I /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/Headers"
then clean your build directory (rm -rf * inside build) and run cmake again. 

Note you will need to "locate cblas.h" on your machine and replace the path to cblas.h
in the CXXFLAGS line above with the path on your specific machine.

# Adding your code

For timing:

You will need to modify the benchmark.cpp code to add timing instrumentation, to 
report FLOPs executed, and so forth.


For vector-matrix multiplication:

There are stub routines inside dgemv-basic.cpp, dgemv-vectorized.cpp, and dgemv-openmp.cpp where you can add your code for doing basic, vectorized, and OpenMP-parallel vector-matrix multiply, respectively.

For the OpenMP parallel code, note that you specify concurrency at runtime using
the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable. While it is possible to set the number of
concurrent OpenMP threads at compile time, it is generally considered better practice to
specify the number of OpenMP threads via the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.

<br></br>

# Running the codes

There is a sample job script provided for running the OpenMP code at 3 levels of concurrency: 1, 4, 8 threads. You may launch that script either as a batch job using the sbatch command, or you may run it as a shell script from an interactive node (preferred).

For the other codes -- benchmark-blas, benchmark-basic, and benchmark-vectorized -- it is easiest to run these from the command line from an interactive node by typing:

   `srun ./benchmark-basic`  
   or  
   `srun ./benchmark-vectorized`  
   or  
   `srun ./benchmark-blas`
